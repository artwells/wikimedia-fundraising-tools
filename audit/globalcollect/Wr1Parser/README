== Overview ==
This is a collection of scripts which will allow you to turn a wr1 file (which
is a collection of records of different data types) into something useful. It
allows you to iterate over the file line-by-line (record-by-record) and gives
you structured data objects for record types of your choosing.

At the moment, this only processes data records of the type "XON", which are
records of credit card transactions that have been approved, as well as "+IP",
which maps to all non-credit card or direct debit payments that have settled.


== Usage ==
First, require Wr1DataRecord.php. Then, instantiate a Wr1DataFileParser object
with a specified Wr1 file. Then, call Wr1DataRecord->getRecordIterator() which 
will return an iterable object, which on each iteration, will return the
subsequent data record in the wr1 file for which we have defined a parser.

Example:
<?php
require_once( 'Wr1DataRecord.php' );
$wr1_parser = new Wr1DataFileParser( '65701332.wr1' );
foreach( $wr1_parser->getRecordIterator() as $record ) {
	// do stuff with the record contained in $record
} 
?>

== Add data types to parse ==
In order to extend this to be useful for data types beyond "XON", you will need
to create a new subclass of Wr1DataRecord. The subclass will need a private 
object property called '$fieldPositionMap' and a method called 
'getLocalFieldPositionMap', which returns an array defining the fields and their
positions in the data record. Use what has been done in 
Wr1DataRecord_CreditCard_Processed as a guide.

The field mappings from GlobalCollect can be found in the GlobalCollect WDL
