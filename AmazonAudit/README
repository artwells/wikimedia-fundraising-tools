-- Amazon Auditing Script --

INSTALLATION
apt-get install python-stompy

CONFIGURATION
The amazon-audit.cfg script is provided as a base template. Although this file
can be modified it is recommended you create a site-local.cfg file and feed
it to the script with the '-c' option.

RUNNING
This script requires one arguments which is:
- the number of seconds into the past to look for lost transactions

It is recommended to also use the following options
-g  The number of seconds of grace
-i  Specifies a history file where pending transactions can be placed for future
    processing on the next run and tells the script on the next run where it left off
-l  Specifies a log file which contains details about things that happened

So, amazon-audit.py -g 86400 462000 will search 5 days into the past ignoring any
transaction that occurred within the last 24 hours.

It is required that you tell the script what it needs to audit. At the moment this script
can audit 'Payment' and 'Refund' FPS operations. These are specified by --auditPayments and
--auditRefunds respectively.
